To run the webdriver, please ensure that all the python modules have been installed and that you've installed a Selenium webdriver, which is stored in your machine's default package folder.

From there, you'll need to activate your webdriver. Below is a stackoverflow post with instructions for the Chromedriver we use for our project.

We recommend that you run our project through two_stage.py, which calls on the other modules contained within this repo.
