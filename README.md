# EnergyArbitrage
Optimizing the arbitrage opportunities of power cost differences with a battery network - DABP final project


## Team Members: Colton Lapp, Justin Poser, Ryan Shen

# 1. Background:

Real time temporal arbitrage is seen as a key source of revenue for battery storage systems. With real time temporal arbitrage, charging happens at periods where electricity prices are cheapest, and energy is discharged from batteries to the grid during peak demand periods, where electricity fetches high prices. The New York Independent Service Operator (NYISO) operates the state’s wholesale power market, including power markets, contracts that control transmission, and related products. Every day, the New York ISO issues a 24 hour forecast of energy prices at 11 AM.

For the purposes of our project, we’ll assume (for now) that our energy storage system utilizes lithium ion batteries, which, at the moment, have the highest round-trip efficiency (how much energy is retained when electricity transfers from the grid to the battery and vice versa). The choice of battery will decide our capacity constraints. We’ll also focus on generators in N.Y.C and expand to more zones depending on computational bandwidth.
